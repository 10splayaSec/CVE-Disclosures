## Description

ChurchCRM 4.5.3 contains a CSV/Formula injection vulnerability via the `Last Name` and `First Name` input fields when creating a new person. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary code through a crafted Excel file, which could be potentially harmful.

## Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to `/churchcrm/PersonEditor.php` endpoint. Create a user with the `First Name` and `Last Name` being `=HYPERLINK("https://google.com", "CLICK ME")`. Fill out the remainder of the form and click `Save and Add` at the bottom of the webpage.

3. Using Microsoft Excel, open the CSV file, and you will see the `CLICK ME` is clickable. Once the user clicks on the `CLICK ME`, they will be redirected to Google.
