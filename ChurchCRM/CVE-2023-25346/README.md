## Description

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ChurchCRM 4.5.3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the `id` parameter of the `/churchcrm/v2/family/not-found` endpoint.

## Proof of Concept

1. Using the payload `churchcrm/v2/person/not-found?id="><script>alert(1)</script>`, an alert box will appear on the webpage, indicating the Javascript code ran successfully.
